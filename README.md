# First-Assigment
This is where the first assigment for the course will be uploaded; here, I will explain how to transform a dataset with .gtf format, to a .tsv format.

The file I am going to use is one part of the genome of the japanese flatworm Schistosoma japonicum, which is taken from the UCSC web page.
The idea when transformin this file into a .tsv format is to visualize all the information in 11 organized columns, separated by vertical lines.

The routine shown was created with AI's help, specifically Chatgpt and Gemini.
